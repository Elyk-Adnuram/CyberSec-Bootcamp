● An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly until the user enters a zero value, then determines and outputs the largest of the numbers that were entered.

Create a variable called "max_integer"
	Set "max_integer" to 0
Request positive integer from user
Store the input from user in a array called "user_integers"
	WHILE "user_integers" does not include zero
		Continue to request an integer from the user
		IF input from user is more than "max_integer"
			Set "max_integer" to value of user input
        Once the user has entered a zero, stop requesting more integers
	Print out the "max_integer"


● An algorithm that requests a user to input their name and then stores their name in a variable called first_name. Subsequently, the algorithm should print out first_name along with the phrase “Hello, World”.

Request a user to enter their name
	WHILE user input is an empty string or not a valid string
			Continue to request that the user enters their name
			IF the user has entered a valid string
				Store the user input in a variable called "first_name"
				Print "first_name" + “Hello, World”
		

● An algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then returns their arithmetic average.
Read integers and store them in an array called "integers"
	Determine the total of the "integers" array
		Store the total of the "integers" array in a variable called "sum"
	Determine the length of the "integers" array
		Store the length of the "integers" array in a variable called "count"
	Divide "sum" by "count"
		Store the result of the above in a variable called "average"
			Return the "average"


● An algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products (in alphabetical order) that are still left to buy. 
Read the grocery list
	IF a grocery item has been bought
		Store grocery item into "bought" list
	ELSE store grocery item into "unbought" list
		Sort the "unbought" list into alphabetical order
			Print the "unbought" list

● An algorithm for the flowchart
Create variable called "X"
	store value of "X" into a variable called "X"
Create variable called "Y"
	store value of "Y" into a variable called "Y"
Create variable called "S"
	set the value of "S" equal to "X" plus "Y"
Create a variable called "A"
	set "A" equal to "S" divided by 2
Create variable called "P"
	set "P" equal to "X" multiple by "Y"

Print the variables "S", "A" and "P"
